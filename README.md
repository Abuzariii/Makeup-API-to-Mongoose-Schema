# Makeup-API-to-Mongoose-Schema

Web App to fetch data from makeup api and then store it in a mongoose schema to build a makeup app. I will use this schema to build a full stack makeup website soon.


## How to use

Add your own .env file in the backend folder and add MONGO_URL and PORT variables of your own, install the packages in both frontend and backend folders, run the server with `npm run dev` command, frontend with `npm start` command, fetch the data by clicking the `FETCH` button and wait for a few seconds, the data will be displayed below the button then finally press the `POST` and the data will be stored in your mongoose schema.
